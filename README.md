# AppendComma
Sublime package to append commas at the end of a line.

Place a comma at the end of the cursor's current line(s) by pressing:
+ <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> on OS X
+ <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> on Windows and Linux

You can also automatically go to the next line at the same time with these shortcuts:
+ <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> on OS X
+ <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> on Windows and Linux

## Other Features
+ If a line already ends with a comma, no comma will be added
+ When appending a comma to a line ending in a comment, the comma will be placed before the comment

## Installation

Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) and search for AppendComma
